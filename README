This is a small, fake bootstrap package that does the work of downloading
the necessary tarballs for P4Python and installing them.

This is meant to be installed from the Python Package Index using easy_install.
A package for P4PythonInstaller will not actually be installed. Any error
output claiming this is an empty or broken package should be ignored.

Usage instructions:

  $ sudo easy_install P4PythonInstaller
